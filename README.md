# Patient Care Coordination & Telemedicine Platform

## Overview

This project is a cloud-native, AI-powered platform designed to streamline patient care coordination and enable secure, efficient telemedicine services. It centralizes communication among care teams, consolidates patient data from multiple sources, and automates care workflows to improve outcomes, reduce administrative burden, and enhance patient and provider experiences.

## Features

- **Care Team Communication:**  
  Secure, real-time messaging and notifications for doctors, nurses, care coordinators, patients, and authorized family members.

- **Telemedicine:**  
  Integrated video consultations using Amazon Chime SDK.

- **Unified Patient Dashboard:**  
  Aggregates medical records, care plans, appointments, and communications in a single view.

- **Automated Care Workflows:**  
  AI-driven alerts for care gaps, task assignment, and care plan updates.

- **Document Management:**  
  Secure upload, storage, and sharing of medical documents and images.

- **EHR Integration:**  
  HL7 FHIR-based APIs for seamless data exchange with existing healthcare systems.

- **Role-Based Access Control:**  
  Ensures HIPAA-compliant data privacy and granular permissions.

- **Patient & Family Portals:**  
  Empower patients and caregivers to access information, communicate, and participate in care decisions.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (web), React Native (mobile), Socket.io (real-time)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express), Python (FastAPI for AI), Microservices architecture
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (relational data), Amazon S3 (documents)
- **AI/NLP:** AWS Bedrock, Amazon Comprehend Medical
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS Lambda, API Gateway, RDS, EventBridge, Step Functions, SNS
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption, MFA, audit logging, role-based access

## Project Structure

```
/frontend         # React.js web app
/mobile           # React Native mobile app
/backend
  /services       # Microservices (auth, patient, care, messaging, telemedicine, integration, notifications)
  /ai             # AI/NLP modules
/infrastructure   # AWS CloudFormation, Terraform scripts
/docs             # Design docs, API specs, compliance guides
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   `git clone https://github.com/your-org/care-coordination-platform.git`

2. **Run the Setup Script**
   Execute `bash setup.sh` to install required packages and create the Python
   virtual environment. The script automatically detects your package manager
   (Homebrew, apt, yum, dnf, pacman, or choco).

3. **Set Up Environment**
   - Install Node.js, Python, Docker, and AWS CLI.
   - Configure AWS credentials with appropriate permissions.

4. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   - Use provided CloudFormation or Terraform scripts in `/infrastructure` to provision AWS resources.

5. **Start Backend Services**
   - Run `docker-compose up` in `/backend` to launch microservices locally.

6. **Run Frontend and Mobile Apps**
   - Start the web app: `npm start` in `/frontend`
   - Start the mobile app: `npx react-native run-ios` or `run-android` in `/mobile`

7. **Configure EHR Integrations**
   - Set up FHIR endpoints and test data exchange.

8. **Access the Platform**
   - Web: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Mobile: Use emulator or device

## Compliance & Security

- **HIPAA-ready:**  
  All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Access is strictly controlled and audited.
- **Audit Trails:**  
  Every data access and modification is logged for compliance.
- **Patient Consent:**  
  Patients control what information is shared and with whom.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Write clear, well-documented code and tests.
3. Submit a pull request describing your changes.

## Roadmap

- [ ] MVP: Messaging, dashboard, telemedicine, document sharing
- [ ] Advanced care workflows, AI-driven alerts, multi-EHR integration
- [ ] Predictive analytics, population health, expanded patient tools
