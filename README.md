 ## CareConnect Pro - Patient Care Coordination & Telemedicine Platform: This project is a cloud-native, AI-powered platform designed to streamline patient care coordination across multiple healthcare providers and systems. It aims to enhance communication, improve patient outcomes, and ensure compliance with healthcare regulations.

   Empower patients and caregivers to access information, communicate, and participate in care decisions.
 
 ## Technical Stack
 
 - **Frontend:** React.js (web), React Native (mobile), Socket.io (real-time)
 - **Backend:** Node.js (Express), Python (FastAPI for AI), Microservices architecture
 - **Database:** PostgreSQL (relational data), Amazon S3 (documents)
 - **AI/NLP:** AWS Bedrock, Amazon Comprehend Medical
 - **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS Lambda, API Gateway, RDS, EventBridge, Step Functions, SNS
 - **Security:** End-to-end encryption, MFA, audit logging, role-based access

 ## Getting Started
 
-1. **Clone the Repository**  
+1. **Clone the Repository**
    `git clone https://github.com/your-org/care-coordination-platform.git`
 
-2. **Set Up Environment**  
+2. **Run the Setup Script**
+   Execute `bash setup.sh` to install required packages and create the Python
+   virtual environment. The script automatically detects your package manager
+   (Homebrew, apt, yum, dnf, pacman, or choco).
+
+3. **Set Up Environment**
    - Install Node.js, Python, Docker, and AWS CLI.
    - Configure AWS credentials with appropriate permissions.
 
-3. **Deploy Infrastructure**  
+4. **Deploy Infrastructure**
    - Use provided CloudFormation or Terraform scripts in `/infrastructure` to provision AWS resources.
 
-4. **Start Backend Services**  
+5. **Start Backend Services**
    - Run `docker-compose up` in `/backend` to launch microservices locally.
 
-5. **Run Frontend and Mobile Apps**  
+6. **Run Frontend and Mobile Apps**
    - Start the web app: `npm start` in `/frontend`
    - Start the mobile app: `npx react-native run-ios` or `run-android` in `/mobile`
 
-6. **Configure EHR Integrations**  
+7. **Configure EHR Integrations**
    - Set up FHIR endpoints and test data exchange.
 
-7. **Access the Platform**  
+8. **Access the Platform**
    - Web: `http://localhost:3000`
    - Mobile: Use emulator or device
 
 ## Compliance & Security
 
 - **HIPAA-ready:**  
   All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Access is strictly controlled and audited.
 - **Audit Trails:**  
   Every data access and modification is logged for compliance.
 - **Patient Consent:**  
   Patients control what information is shared and with whom.
 
 ## Contributing
 
 1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
 2. Write clear, well-documented code and tests.
 3. Submit a pull request describing your changes.
 
 ## Roadmap
 
 - [ ] MVP: Messaging, dashboard, telemedicine, document sharing
 - [ ] Advanced care workflows, AI-driven alerts, multi-EHR integration
