The repository outlines a telemedicine platform with AI-powered care coordination. According to the project README, the backend stack includes Node.js services, Python modules for AI, and PostgreSQL for relational data storage. The AI coding prompt specifically calls for creating “core database models” and setting up PostgreSQL schemas for users, patients, providers, and care teams.

Suggested Schema Components
Based on the documentation, a foundational schema should include:

Users

id (UUID) – primary key

email (unique, not null)

role (enum/user role)

created_at (timestamp)

Patients

id (UUID) – primary key

user_id (foreign key to Users)

date_of_birth

medical_record_number

other patient-specific fields

Providers

id (UUID) – primary key

user_id (foreign key to Users)

specialty

credentials

organization_id (if multi-tenant)

Care Teams

id (UUID) – primary key

name

created_at

description

Care Team Members

care_team_id (foreign key to Care Teams)

user_id (foreign key to Users)

role within the care team (e.g., coordinator, provider)

Messaging / Communication

id (UUID) – primary key

sender_id (foreign key to Users)

receiver_id or care_team_id

message_body

timestamp

This structure reflects the core user roles and communication features listed in the README and design documents. Using an enum or lookup table for roles ensures role-based access control, also highlighted as a major feature.

Turning the Environment into an “AI Guru”
To make the platform provide intelligent guidance, consider implementing:

AI/NLP Module: A FastAPI microservice (as noted in the README’s tech stack) that analyzes patient data or care plans, built on AWS Bedrock or Comprehend Medical for entity extraction and recommendations.

Knowledge Base: Ingest the project’s docs (e.g., ai_prompt.md and design_plan.md) into a vector store. Provide a simple script or chatbot that queries this store using an embedding-based search to assist developers with context-aware answers.

Automated Code or Schema Validation: Incorporate a linter or schema validator in the CI/CD pipeline. The repository’s documentation references GitHub Actions for testing and deployment tasks.

These steps will help transform the environment into a more self-guiding “AI guru” by combining a structured schema with AI-driven insights and accessible documentation.
